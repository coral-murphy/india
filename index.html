          <p data-image="assets/maya.jpg" data-position="center">SATARA, INDIA — One hot morning in March, 43-year-old health worker Maya Ankusharao was dreading the end of her work day.  Since India mandated in 2016 that rural health workers use smartphones for data entry, Ankusharao comes home each night exhausted, with piles of pen and paper health records that her 20 year old son helps her input into four different apps in her phone.</p>

After a nationwide push towards digitization in 2015, the government of India has pushed for ASHA workers, an acronym for Accredited Social Health Activists, to use smartphones as the “preferred medium” for their work.  </p>

            <p>The government requires ASHA workers to track different health conditions and diseases in multiple apps, a pesky process for anyone. But for many adult women in rural India, the learning curve is especially steep. For some ASHA workers, this is the first time they’ve used a smartphone, and villages are relying on their tech knowledge to keep the health system afloat.  </p>

            <p>India’s government had a massive push towards digitization starting in 2016, with efforts to reach even the most remote parts of the country. But there was a disconnect: the heads of the household – mostly husbands and fathers – were given smartphones, not women. There was also not enough training for ASHA workers on how to use phones.  </p>

            <p>For women in the most remote areas, the efforts to bridge India's digital segment fell short. This caused delays and frustrations over tech in sectors including healthcare and for ASHA workers. </p>

            <p>ASHA workers only receive a partial stipend to buy a phone, about ₹100 rupees ($1.20 USD). An average, used smartphone might cost t ₹10000 rupees (around $120 USD). These women must also incur in the costs of cellular data for internet access. In Maharashtra, ASHA workers receive 10000 rupees a month (or about $120).  </p>

            
     <p>Though India’s Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has praised itself for having “the world’s largest community volunteer programme” of ASHA workers, the women themselves have demanded higher wages and benefits and asked tobe recognized as official, salaried employees. </p>

            <p>Amid these demands, massive strikes broke out last year, with thousands of ASHA workers demanding better pay. The perception that ASHA workers are more akin to informal laborers rather than essential primary care workers has led to delays in payment and unkept promises of higher wages. </p>

 
   <p>Historically, ASHA workers haven’t had a fixed salary; they’ve received cash incentives based on their performance, coming to an average of around ₹2580 rupees per month from incentives ($36 USD) or ₹765 rupees ($11 USD) for pregnancy checkups and home visits. </p>

            <p>In March, their demands were finally met with the government passing a ₹5000 rupee hike in monthly stipends ($60 USD), a big win for the women serving as the backbone of the rural health system. But across the country, ASHA workers are still struggling with smartphone costs and difficulty using its technology.
