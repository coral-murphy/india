          <p data-image="assets/maya.jpg" data-position="left">SATARA, INDIA — One hot morning in March, 43-year-old health worker Maya Ankusharao was dreading the end of her work day. Since India mandated in 2016 that rural health workers use smartphones for data entry, Ankusharao comes home each night exhausted, with piles of pen and paper health records that her 20-year-old son helps her input into four different apps in her phone.</p>

          <p data-image="assets/asha_hands.jpg" data-position="center">"I wasn't able to work with the mobile phone whatsoever," Ankusharao said. "I don’t understand English. I would ask a friend and, if the friend didn’t understand English, I would ask my kid."</p>

          <p data-image="assets/asha_group.jpg" data-position="right">Ankusharao isn’t alone with her struggle. After a nationwide push towards expanding digital literacy and infrastructure in 2015, the government of India has pushed for ASHA workers, an acronym for Accredited Social Health Activists, to use smartphones as the medium for their work. But for some of these women, it’s the first time they get their hands on a device to get their jobs done.  </p>
          
          <p data-image="assets/asha_phones.jpg" data-position="center">ASHA workers only receive a partial stipend to buy a phone, about ₹100 rupees ($1.20 USD). An average, used smartphone might cost ₹10000 rupees (around $120 USD). These women must also incur in the costs of cellular data for internet access. In Maharashtra, ASHA workers receive 10000 rupees a month (or about $120). </p>

            <p>Since 2012, over 1 million women community health ASHA workers have been deployed to address the healthcare needs of a country with a population of 1.4 billion people, particularly in rural areas. Maharashtra alone, the district where Satara is located, has about 70,282 ASHA workers.  </p>

            
            <p>They visit their neighbors and community members to deliver health supplies such as contraceptives or basic drugs, while also disseminating health information on sanitation, infant care or diseases like malaria.</p>

            <p>The government requires ASHA workers to track different health conditions and diseases in multiple apps, a pesky process for anyone. But for many adult women in rural India, the learning curve is especially steep. For some ASHA workers, this is the first time they’ve used a smartphone, and villages are relying on their tech knowledge to keep the health system afloat.</p>

            <p>"For the ones who are a bit more educated, it was slightly easier," said Poonam Bhosale, another ASHA worker in Satara. "But for those of us who don’t understand English or know how to use a phone, it was very difficult." </p>

            <p>India’s government had a massive push towards digitization starting in 2015, with efforts to reach even the most remote parts of the country. But there was a disconnect: the heads of the household – mostly husbands and fathers – were given smartphones, not women. There was also not enough training for ASHA workers on how to use phones.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6">

            <p>Many of them hadn’t touched a smartphone prior to or during digitization efforts, but were now being asked to use it as a major part of their job. </p>

            <p>“They’re not very deft at managing smartphones because they didn’t own them,” said Brinelle D'souza, a professor Health Systems and Community Health at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai. “Among low income groups, women have very limited access, so it might be their children who own them or their husbands.” </p>

            
     <p>She added that when it comes to internet access in rural areas, “it’s not very good,” compounding ASHA workers’ issues even further. Out of the country’s 593,615 inhabited villages, more than 25,000 villages lacked mobile connectivity and Internet in 2022, according to data published by the Ministry of Communications. </p>

            <p>The costs of a smartphone and internet are also an uphill battle when compensation for their work is still a thorny issue. Historically, ASHA workers haven’t had a fixed salary; they’ve received cash incentives based on their performance, coming to an average of around ₹2580 rupees per month from incentives ($36 USD) or ₹765 rupees ($11 USD) for pregnancy checkups and home visits.  </p>

 
   <p>In March, their demands were finally met with the government passing a ₹5000 rupee hike in monthly stipends ($60 USD), a big win for the women serving as the backbone of the rural health system. But across the country, ASHA workers are still struggling with smartphone costs, difficulty using its technology, and poor internet access.  </p>

            <p>Rukmini Jadhav, an ASHA worker in Satara, remembers the quest she embarked in to take the vitals of about 500 people in her community. A message in her phone kept letting her know of the faulty internet access, and she had to improvise to get the job done.   </p>

            <p>“We had to take each of the beneficiaries to the [internet] cafe,” Jadhav said. “The government told us to do this on the mobile but that isn’t possible. We had to go home-to-home and take each beneficiary to the cafes. We were sitting at the cafes until 9 and 10 at night.”</p>
            <p>“Even the cafes didn’t have the best network. We would make do with however much we could get,” she added.</p>
